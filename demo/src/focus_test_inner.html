        Focus cannot be moved to our opening frame, even programmatically. <br>
        Clicking the following button will NOT move focus out of this iframe: <br>
        <button onclick="parentButton.focus();" demo-button></button>
    </li>
    <li>
        Vimium (browser extension) does not generate hints for elements in parent window or opening frame <br>
        (TODO - not currently working - I still can't figure out how vimium decides whether or not to show hints for a particular element, and haven't managed to hide these)
    </li>
