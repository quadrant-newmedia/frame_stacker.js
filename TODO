When removing layer, add unload listener (which will be fired when it is removed from DOM)
Once it's removed, destroy the frame-stacker-container, if empty
ditch frame-stacker.css and set the styles in-line on on the container

add license comment to js file

build/release refactor
- update version_number
- build reads this, names the built file appropriately, updates working_build symlink
- release ensures clean repo, then writes git tag, then pushes

version_number -> file with version number
latest_release -> symlink to latest release
demo/
	src/
	release/ -> symlink to src/
src/
releases/
	frame_stacker.0.0.0.js

Make the demo more explanatory -> it's the tutorial/documentation too
Setup github pages, link from readme
